# AnantaSphere: Redefining AR/VR Wearable Experiences

My work is based on research on many apps but especially the Apple Vision Pro, one of the leading AR/VR devices. Although these devices come with advanced features, they also face problems like being bulky, less emotion-based interactive, and lacking intuitive control. I'm trying to resolve these issues by introducing AnantaSphere, a wearable AR/VR ecosystem with lightweight design, emotion-based adaptability, and gesture control.

- Low emotional responsiveness → AnantaSphere changes AR/VR environments in real time by using AI-driven biometric monitoring based on the user's emotions.  
- Bulky and clumsy designs → Our device has a sleek, ergonomic design to be worn all day long.  
- Controller dependency → Hands-free interaction via gesture and voice recognition.  

## Key Features of AnantaSphere

- Mood-responsive environment – AR/VR will evolve with mood, using real-time biometric analysis. 
AI-based personalization – Intelligent algorithmic suggestion for personalized content and interactions.
Fusion of Seamless AR/VR – Integrating the real-world for an overall immersive experience. 
Control based on gesture and voice – Natural gestures and commands for hands-free operation.
Intelligent learning help – Automatically provides educational videos and exercises for every thought.
- Mind-responsive entertainment – Plays music, movies, or games based on emotional state.  

## Prototyping Process  

- SCAMPER analysis – Explored possibilities to innovate over current AR/VR limitations.  
- Storyboard visualization – Outlined user interactions for a seamless experience.  
- Morphological table – Analyzed key system components for efficiency.  
- Figma prototype – Designed a clean, user-friendly UI to enhance usability.
